- 👋 Hi, I’m @maestro-aj
- 👀 I’m interested in software architecture, especially in domains like asset and wealth management, fintech, and scalable enterprise solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ on Visual Studio Code, as well as .NET Core, C#, and advancing my knowledge in Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Microservices, with a focus on Azure Cloud solutions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving vertical slice architecture, microservices, cloud-native applications, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), and distributed systems.
